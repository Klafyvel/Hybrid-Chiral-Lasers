The study presented in this report was purely theoretical and numerical. However, the field studied is rich in experimental applications. This section aims to quickly present several experimental studies on chiral media.

The ability of chiral media to reflect only circularly polarised light allows several animal species to display unique visual aspects thanks to the microscopic structure of \textit{e.g.} their shell in the case for beetles. \Textcite{erten_experimental_2015} successfully used this property to classify beetles among five categories, according to the spectral properties of the reflected light from their shells.

Coupled wave theory prediction of circular Bragg phenomenon was also demonstrated by \textcite{carter_variation_2016}, by experimentating with obliquely incident light on structurally chiral media deposited on a metallic substrate.

Structurally chiral media can also be produced with the help of liquid-crystals. Thus, band-edge lasing has been known for a long time\cite{barna_band_2005}. A key property of liquid-crystals is their ability to change topology when electrically stimulated. \Textcite{maune_liquid-crystal_2004} and \textcite{xiang_electrically_2016} demonstrated an electrically tuned liquid-crystal laser.
