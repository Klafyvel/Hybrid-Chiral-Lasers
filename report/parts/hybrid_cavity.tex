\section{Hybrid cavity}

The third design simulated was a hybrid cavity consisting of a right-handed chiral gain medium placed between two left-handed chiral media acting as reflectors for left-circularly polarised light reflectors. The design is schematised in figure \ref{fig:hybrid}.

The lasing action of the cavity is simulated using the same method as before with the parameters given in table \ref{tab:hybrid_cavity:simulation}. Losses were added in the reflectors because otherwise zero-gain modes can be found. This makes sense mathematically because that means such modes are able to perform a round-trip in the cavity without being altered, but does not correspond to any physical reality as mirrors are necessary slightly lossy. Figure \ref{fig:hybrid_cavity:mycwt_surf} shows the lasing coefficient found with approximate theory (the result with exact theory was very close and thus is not shown). The corresponding output modes are then calculated for both method, and the intensity distributions are plotted in figure \ref{fig:hybrid_cavity:modes}.

The first thing to be noted is that this geometry produces very pure left or right circularly polarised modes. The second thing is that mode 1 requires left-handed light coming from the outside of the cavity. This is attributed to an imprecise localisation of this mode. The three displayed modes illustrate the dynamics at play in the cavity leading to the two possible output handedness. First, for left-handed output polarisations, light is not reflected by right-handed medium and travels in left-handed media, leading to chirality-preserving reflections schematised in figure \ref{fig:hybrid:mechanism_lh}. Then, for right-handed modes, the cavity acts as a simple cavity\cite{topf_modes_2014} with index-matched media at the interfaces, thus providing pure right-handed circularly polarised output as there are no Fabry-PÃ©rot modes. This dynamic is  shown in figure \ref{fig:hybrid:mechanism_rh} and explains mode 3 in figure \ref{fig:hybrid_cavity:modes}.

\subsection{Conclusion on hybrid cavity}

The hybrid cavity geometry solves the issue of impurities present in the output of a simple cavity and a defect cavity. This is because the hybrid geometry simplifies the dynamics of reflections in the cavity, removing the chirality-reversing reflections due to unmatched index interfaces. The left-handed modes require higher gain, because of the losses in left-handed media where the reflections occur.
