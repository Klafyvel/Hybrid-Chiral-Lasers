\section{Cavity with a defect}
\label{sec:defect_cavity}
The first new geometry explored is a cavity with a defect. This is a cavity with geometry very similar to the one described in section \ref{sec:simple_cavity}, except that the helix is "broken" exactly at the centre of the cavity. This means the cavity is modelled by two identical chiral media, one of which as a start angle different from the other. This geometry is schematized in figure \ref{fig:defect}.

\subsection{Reflectivities}

As with the first cavity, the passive reflectivity is examined. This cavity is expected to behave as a very selective filter. Figure \ref{fig:defect_reflectivity} shows three reflectivity plots of right-handed cavities. The simplest is probably the first one, \ref{fig:defect_reflectivity:reflect}, with a $\frac{\pi}{2}$ defect and no losses. The narrow band filter behaviour is present at the Bragg wavelength, \textit{i.e.} $\Re{\bar{n}}\times L_p$\cite{mccall_simplified_2009}. Then, \ref{fig:defect_reflectivity:reflect_losses} shows that the introduction of losses in the medium decreases the filtering efficiency. Finally, by varying the angle of the defect, it is possible to tune the zero-reflectivity wavelength, as shown in figure \ref{fig:defect_reflectivity:reflect_other}. The transmitivities were also calculated, but do not show any remarkable feature that is not already displayed by reflectivities. Transmitivities are shown in appendix \ref{chap:transmitivities}.

\subsection{Laser action}

With the same methodology as before, lasing action is examined in the defect cavity. Figure \ref{fig:defect_cavity:surf} shows the positions of laser modes found for a cavity parametrised by table \ref{tab:defect_cavity:simulation}. The exact and approximate theories yield similar results.

		Length of the chiral medium & $L$ & $2\times10\times L_p$ \\

		Average refractive index of the chiral medium (Re) & $\bar{n}$ & 1.7690 \\

Figure \ref{fig:defect_cavity:modes_found} displays the corresponding output modes. This shows the modes outputted by this laser are still un-pure. However, the hypothesis on the strong confinement of right-handed polarised light turns out to be verified. Indeed, figure \ref{fig:defect_cavity:intensity_distribution} shows that mode 2 provides such a confinement.

It was also found that the angle of the defect was a handful way of tuning the cavity. Indeed, by changing the angle of the second slab of chiral medium, a whole range of lasing modes was made available. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:defect_cavity:tuning}. An animation is also available at \url{http://klafyvel.me/lasing_coeff_defect.avi}.

\subsection{Conclusion on the cavity with a defect}
	
This geometry does not produce pure circularly-polarised light. However it allows for interesting features such as highly selective band filter and fine laser tuning. The benefits of this cavity could be adapted in future designs in conjunction with a design allowing the output of purer circular modes.
