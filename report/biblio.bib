	abstract = {An extended spectroscopic study on the left-through-left circularly polarized reflection spectra of a large number of beetles from the Australasian Scrabaeidae:Cetoniinae of the Lomaptera genus was undertaken. We have obtained a five-category spectral classification. The principal spectral features, which even within the genus range from blue to infrared, are related to structural chirality in the beetle shells. The detailed features of each spectral classification are related to different structural perturbations of the helix, including various pitch values and abrupt twist defects. These spectral characteristics and associated shell structures are confirmed on the basis of simple modelling. An important conclusion from our study is that the simple helical structure resulting in a single symmetric Bragg peak is not the dominant spectral type. Rather the reality is a rich tapestry of spectral types. One intriguing specimen is identified via a scanning electron micrograph to consist of a double interstitial helix leading to a particular double-peak spectrum.},

However, the most desired mode to tune the laser, by an electric field, has so far been elusive. Here we present the realization of an electrically tunable laser with λ⎯⎯λ¯{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/{MathML}"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mover accent="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}λ{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}¯{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mover{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater} spanning an extraordinarily broad range ({\textgreater}100 nm) of the visible spectrum. The effect is achieved by using an electric-field-induced oblique helicoidal ({OH}) state in which the molecules form an acute angle with the helicoidal axis rather than align perpendicularly to it as in a field-free {CLC}. The principal advantage of the electrically controlled {CLCOH} laser is that the electric field is applied parallel to the helical axis and thus changes the pitch but preserves the single-harmonic structure. The preserved single-harmonic structure ensures efficiency of lasing in the entire tunable range of emission. The broad tuning range of {CLCOH} lasers, coupled with their microscopic size and narrow line widths, may enable new applications in areas such as diagnostics, sensing, microscopy, displays, and holography.},

Analytic expressions for the transmission and reflection coefficients of the defect mode structure ({CLC}-defect layer-{CLC}) are presented and analyzed for nonabsorbing, absorbing and amplifying {CLC}. The effect of anomalously strong light absorption at the defect mode frequency is revealed. It is shown that in {DFB} lasing in a defect structure adjusting of the lasing frequency to the {DM} frequency results in a significant lowering of the lasing threshold. Numerical solutions of the {DM} dispersion equation are performed for typical values of the related parameters.},

	abstract = {Unlike humans, numerous animals are differentially sensitive to the vector orientation of linearly polarized light. However as early as 1844 Haidinger noted that weak blue–yellow brushes appear, centered on the fovea, when the sky is observed through a slowly rotating polarizer. Different models have been proposed to try to understand this phenomenon, but the precise mechanism remains unknown and the polarization unexploited. We suggest that when Fresnel’s laws are applied to the unguided oblique rays, that the cylindrical geometry of the blue cones in the fovea along with their distribution induces an extrinsic dichroism and could explain why the human eye is sensitive to polarization. We have constructed an artificial eye model system using the same laws and were able to photograph the appearance of entoptic-like blue-dark brushes, confirming the observations and our mathematical simulations. Moreover, our in vivo and in vitro tests show that in addition to the usual 3s fading time measured using a stationary stimulus, there exists for this entoptic image a short extra creating and erasing time of about 0.1s, using a dynamical stimulus. We have also found that, surprisingly, the rotating pattern is more regular and symmetrical with one of our two eyes around a more circular blue cone-free area, the dominant eye. Our results suggest that the polarization sense can provide important information in many areas that remain to be explored.},

	abstract = {We experimentally and numerically show that chirality can play a major role in the nonlinear optical response of soft birefringent materials, by studying the nonlinear propagation of laser beams in frustrated cholesteric liquid crystal samples. Such beams exhibit a periodic nonlinear response associated with a bouncing pattern for the optical fields, as well as a self-focusing effect enhanced by the chirality of the birefringent material. Our results open new possible designs of nonlinear optical devices with low power consumption and tunable interactions with localized topological solitons.},

	abstract = {The work is devoted to the self-action of laser beams propagating in the isotropic phase of a cholesteric liquid crystal near the transition temperature to the mesophase in a wide range of parameter values characterizing the nonlocality of the nonlinear optical response of the medium, defocusing in the medium, the power of incident laser radiation and diﬀraction in the liquid crystal. The origin of the primary singularities of both polarization components of radiation in a wide range of parameters of radiation and the medium is investigated for diﬀerent values of the parameter characterizing the nonlocality of nonlinear optical response in chiral medium. For each of the values, the visibility diagrams of the primary singularities of both polarization components are plotted depending on the parameters of the medium and radiation, and their asymmetry is found.},
